# Satellite Imagery Analysis

Satellite images depict the Earth and are captured by imaging satellites operated by governments and businesses worldwide. In this article, I'll present a data science tutorial on Satellite Imagery Analysis using Python.

In this analysis, I'll guide you through a satellite imagery analysis task focused on the Sundarbans forest in India. The Sundarbans is among the largest mangrove areas situated in the delta formed by the convergence of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers in the Bay of Bengal. Covering approximately 10,000 square kilometers, the Sundarbans Forest spans across India and Bangladesh, with 40% of it located in India. This region is renowned for its rich biodiversity, housing many rare and globally threatened wildlife species.
